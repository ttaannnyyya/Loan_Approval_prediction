# Loan-Approval-prediction
Loan Approval dataset is a popular Kaggle dataset for whether loan would be approved or not based on the loan details such as the loan amount, loan term etc. as well as the loan borrower's detail such as annual income, number of dependents etc. This Model works on the above mentioned dataset and predicts whether or not the loan would be approved.

## Libraries used
This project is entirely done on jupyter notebook in python. I have used the following python libraries :
1. `pandas` to read and visualize the data 
4. `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` for feature scaling
5. `sklearn.svm` for model selection 

## How to implement the project ?!

Steps to implement the project 

1. Open google colab or jupyter notebook.
2. Either download the source code or copy the codes to a new .py file  or new .ipynb file
3. run the codes 


## Accuracy of the model 
It uses Suport vector machine classifier to classify loan_status column based on the dependent columns.The model is 94% accurate.
